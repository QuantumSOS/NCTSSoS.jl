# [Overview of Optimizer](@id overview-of-optimizers)
A brief overview of different Semideinite Program optimizers are provided below.

## [Mosek](@id mosek)
The best there is, period. But closed source.


## [Clarabel](@id clarabel)
Rising star open source implementation of interior
point numerical solver for convex optimization.


## [COSMO](@id cosmo)
First order solver for convex conic optimization via conic
operator splitting method. Generally faster at the cost of low precision.
