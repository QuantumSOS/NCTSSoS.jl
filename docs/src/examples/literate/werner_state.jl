# # Werner State

# Werner states [huber2022dimension](@cite) are a fundamental class of mixed
# quantum states in quantum information theory, named after physicist Reinhard
# Werner who introduced them in his seminal 1989 work on quantum entanglement.
# These states are characterized by their high degree of symmetry - they remain
# invariant under local unitary transformations that are the same on both
# subsystems of a bipartite quantum system. Werner states are particularly
# significant because they provide a clean theoretical framework for studying the
# relationship between quantum entanglement, Bell inequality violations, and
# quantum nonlocality. What makes them especially interesting is that they can
# exist in different regimes: some Werner states are separable (not entangled),
# others are entangled but do not violate Bell inequalities, and still others are
# both entangled and exhibit Bell inequality violations. This rich structure has
# made Werner states a cornerstone for understanding the subtle distinctions
# between different forms of quantum correlations and has led to numerous
# applications in quantum cryptography, quantum communication protocols, and
# fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
