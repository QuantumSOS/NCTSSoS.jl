# Werner State

Werner states [huber2022dimension](@cite) are a fundamental class of mixed
quantum states in quantum information theory, named after physicist Reinhard
Werner who introduced them in his seminal 1989 work on quantum entanglement.
These states are characterized by their high degree of symmetry - they remain
invariant under local unitary transformations that are the same on both
subsystems of a bipartite quantum system. Werner states are particularly
significant because they provide a clean theoretical framework for studying the
relationship between quantum entanglement, Bell inequality violations, and
quantum nonlocality. What makes them especially interesting is that they can
exist in different regimes: some Werner states are separable (not entangled),
others are entangled but do not violate Bell inequalities, and still others are
both entangled and exhibit Bell inequality violations. This rich structure has
made Werner states a cornerstone for understanding the subtle distinctions
between different forms of quantum correlations and has led to numerous
applications in quantum cryptography, quantum communication protocols, and
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

!!! note "Example Coming Soon"
    This example is currently under development. Please check back later for
    the complete implementation showing how to analyze Werner states using
    NCTSSoS.jl."}
