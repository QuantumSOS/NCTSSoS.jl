  abstract = {A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact diagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size, variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy is minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success, rigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy. However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models. To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in a scalable way.},

  abstract = {We provide a new hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations, called NCTSSOS, to solve large-scale sparse noncommutative polynomial optimization problems. This hierarchy features the exploitation of term sparsity hidden in the input data for eigenvalue and trace optimization problems. NCTSSOS complements the recent work that exploits correlative sparsity for noncommutative optimization problems by Klep et al. (MP, 2021), and is the noncommutative analogue of the TSSOS framework by Wang et al. (SIAMJO 31: 114--141, 2021, SIAMJO 31: 30--58, 2021). We also propose an extension exploiting simultaneously correlative and term sparsity, as done previously in the commutative case (Wang in CS-TSSOS: Correlative and term sparsity for large-scale polynomial optimization, 2020). Under certain conditions, we prove that the optima of the NCTSSOS hierarchy converge to the optimum of the corresponding dense semidefinite programming relaxation. We illustrate the efficiency and scalability of NCTSSOS by solving eigenvalue/trace optimization problems from the literature as well as randomly generated examples involving up to several thousand variables.}

  abstract = {"Many applications, including computer vision, computer arithmetic, deep learning, entanglement in quantum information, graph theory and energy networks, can be successfully tackled within the framework of polynomial optimization, an emerging field with growing research efforts in the last two decades. One key advantage of these techniques is their ability to model a wide range of problems using optimization formulations. Polynomial optimization heavily relies on the moment-sums of squares (moment-SOS) approach proposed by Lasserre, which provides certificates for positive polynomials. On the practical side, however, there is "no free lunch" and such optimization methods usually encompass severe scalability issues. Fortunately, for many applications, including the ones formerly mentioned, we can look at the problem in the eyes and exploit the inherent data structure arising from the cost and constraints describing the problem. This book presents several research efforts to resolve this scientific challenge with important computational implications. It provides the development of alternative optimization schemes that scale well in terms of computational complexity, at least in some identified class of problems. It also features a unified modeling framework to handle a wide range of applications involving both commutative and noncommutative variables, and to solve concretely large-scale instances. Readers will find a practical section dedicated to the use of available open-source software libraries. This interdisciplinary monograph is essential reading for students, researchers and professionals interested in solving optimization problems with polynomial input data"--},

  abstract = {This paper introduces state polynomials, i.e., polynomials in noncommuting variables and formal states of their products. A state analog of Artin's solution to Hilbert's 17th problem is proved showing that state polynomials, positive over all matrices and matricial states, are sums of squares with denominators. Somewhat surprisingly, it is also established that a Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz fails to hold in the state polynomial setting. Further, archimedean Positivstellens{\textbackslash}"atze in the spirit of Putinar and Helton-McCullough are presented leading to a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging monotonically to the optimum of a state polynomial subject to state constraints. This hierarchy can be seen as a state analog of the Lasserre hierarchy for optimization of polynomials, and the Navascu{\textbackslash}'es-Pironio-Ac{\textbackslash}'in scheme for optimization of noncommutative polynomials. The motivation behind this theory arises from the study of correlations in quantum networks. Determining the maximal quantum violation of a polynomial Bell inequality for an arbitrary network is reformulated as a state polynomial optimization problem. Several examples of quadratic Bell inequalities in the bipartite and the bilocal tripartite scenario are analyzed. To reduce the size of the constructed SDPs, sparsity, sign symmetry and conditional expectation of the observables' group structure are exploited. To obtain the above-mentioned results, techniques from noncommutative algebra, real algebraic geometry, operator theory, and convex optimization are employed.},

This methodology combines semidefinite programming with recent results from real algebraic geometry to provide a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging to the desired optimal value. Applied on appropriate cones, standard duality in convex optimization nicely expresses the duality between moments and positive polynomials.

  abstract = {Motivated by recent progress in quantum information theory, this article aims at optimizing trace polynomials, i.e., polynomials in noncommuting variables and traces of their products. A novel Positivstellensatz certifying positivity of trace polynomials subject to trace constraints is presented, and a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging monotonically to the optimum of a trace polynomial subject to tracial constraints is provided. This hierarchy can be seen as a tracial analog of the Pironio, Navascu{\textbackslash}'es and Ac{\textbackslash}'in scheme [New J. Phys., 2008] for optimization of noncommutative polynomials. The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction is applied to extract optimizers of the trace optimization problem if flatness and extremality conditions are satisfied. These conditions are sufficient to obtain finite convergence of our hierarchy. The results obtained are applied to violations of polynomial Bell inequalities in quantum information theory. The main techniques used in this paper are inspired by real algebraic geometry, operator theory, and noncommutative algebra.},
