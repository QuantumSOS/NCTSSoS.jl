    AlgebraType

Abstract type representing different algebraic structures with their
commutation/anticommutation relations.

Each concrete algebra type is a singleton struct that enables
multiple dispatch for simplification algorithms.

# Subtypes
- `NonCommutativeAlgebra`: Standard non-commutative variables (xy ≠ yx)
- `PauliAlgebra`: Pauli spin matrices satisfying σᵢ² = I and {σᵢ, σⱼ} = 2δᵢⱼ
- `FermionicAlgebra`: Fermionic creation/annihilation operators with {aᵢ, aⱼ†} = δᵢⱼ
- `BosonicAlgebra`: Bosonic creation/annihilation operators with [aᵢ, cⱼ†] = δᵢⱼ
- `ProjectorAlgebra`: Projector operators satisfying Pᵢ² = Pᵢ (idempotent)
- `UnipotentAlgebra`: Unipotent operators satisfying P² = I

# Design
Singleton types enable zero-cost dispatch on algebra operations:
```julia
simplify(::Type{PauliAlgebra}, m::NormalMonomial) = ...
```

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> PauliAlgebra()
PauliAlgebra()

julia> FermionicAlgebra() isa AlgebraType
true
```

Algebra category where the **normal form of a monomial is still a single monomial**
(i.e. closed on monomials).

This matches a *monoid algebra / monoid ring* viewpoint: basis elements are indexed
by elements of a monoid, and multiplying basis elements yields another basis element
in the same basis (extended linearly to polynomials). [@monoidRing]

In `NCTSSoS.jl`, this category includes:
- `NonCommutativeAlgebra` (free/noncommutative words)

- `UnipotentAlgebra` (involution U² = I)

Algebra category where the **normal form of a monomial is a scalar/phase times a single monomial**.

This matches a *twisted group algebra* viewpoint: basis elements are indexed by a group,
but multiplication is twisted by a scalar 2-cocycle, so products satisfy
`u_g * u_h = α(g,h) u_{gh}`. [@twistedGroupAlgebra]

Algebra category where the **normal form of a monomial expands to a sum of monomials**.

This matches the computational noncommutative algebra pattern of *PBW algebras*: there is
an ordered monomial basis and a rewriting/normal-ordering procedure, but reordering introduces
lower terms, so a product may expand into multiple normal-form monomials. [@pbwAlgebraOscar]

# Variable Encoding
Variables are ordered by site first: σx₁, σy₁, σz₁, σx₂, σy₂, σz₂, ...
For index `idx`: site = `(idx - 1) ÷ 3 + 1`, pauli_type = `(idx - 1) % 3`

Normal ordering places all creation operators (a†) to the LEFT

sign changes, but adds correction terms. Simplification may return
multiple terms.

- All others: `Float64` (real coefficients suffice)

This is used by constructors like `Polynomial(m::NormalMonomial)` to infer
the appropriate coefficient type when not explicitly specified.

processing of simplification results. Used by `ComposedMonomial` simplification
to determine appropriate coefficient types for the Cartesian product of terms.

For `NormalMonomial{A,T}`, returns `coeff_type(A)` (the algebra's default).
