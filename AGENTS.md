# AGENTS.md

## Notes
- Dropping `Term` usually recreates it as `PauliMonomial` (scalar × basis word); expect extra allocation unless you keep a 1-term fast path.
- CCR/CAR (boson/fermion): product of two basis words can expand to a sum; keep moment *labels* as `Monomial{A,T}` basis, and represent matrix entries as linear combinations.
- If you keep separate `Monomial`/`PauliMonomial`/`PhysicsMonomial`, you still need mixed ops (`Monomial×PhysicsMonomial`, distributive `*`, `+`, `adjoint`, sort/dedup/zero-drop) to stay closed.

# AGENTS.md

At start, say hi + 1 inspire line.
Owner: yushengzhao.
Style: *telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop filler; min tokens; ship small diffs; verify before handoff.*
Rule: *ask for clarification if unclear*

## Scope
Codex CLI config tracked in git. Path: `home/configs/codex/`.

## Key Files
- `home/configs/codex/config.toml`: main config (model, MCP, trust).
- `home/codex.nix`: links `~/.codex/config.toml` → `home/configs/codex/config.toml` (`mkOutOfStoreSymlink`).

## Agent Protocol
- Safe default: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`.
- Deletes: use `trash …` (no `rm` unless explicit).
- No destructive git unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, …).
- Prefer root-cause fix; add small regression check when it fits.
- External knowledge: prefer `gm -p "Search {question} online"` (if `gm` exists); else Exa (`mcp__exa__web_search_exa`, `mcp__exa__get_code_context_exa`). Quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2026 sources. Network may require approval.
- “Make a note” => edit this file.

## Skills
These skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/exaclior/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/exaclior/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime "## Skills" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

User:
A lot of trouble are caused due to Monomials not in their normal form. What if I force `Monomial` to be in their normal form by construction? This would guard against a huge range of problems, like being able to compare two Monomials not in their normal form. But the problem is I need to support Fermionic and Bosonic Monomial. A monomial's normal form could be a polynomial. What will be the most elegant way to put this?

Assistant:
Hi.
Small invariants, big leverage.

- Key obstruction: boson/fermion “normal ordering” is `Monomial(word) -> Polynomial(...)` (δ / contraction terms). Julia constructors can’t change the return type, so “`Monomial` always normal by construction” can’t hold globally.
- Clean split: `Monomial` = *basis word only* (guaranteed already normal-ordered); `NormalForm` = `Polynomial` (sparse linear combination) = the canonical algebra element.
- Unify API: `nf(m::Monomial{A})::Polynomial{A}` that wraps `simplify(m)` (if `simplify` returns `Monomial`/`Term`, lift to 1-term `Polynomial`; if it returns `Polynomial`, use it). Then make user-facing arithmetic live on `Polynomial`/`NormalForm` so you never compare raw words.
- Extra guard: for `BosonicAlgebra`/`FermionicAlgebra`, make `Monomial{A}(word)` *reject* non-normal-ordered words (“use `nf`/`simplify`”), so `==/hash/isless` stay meaningful.

Clarify: do you want `*(m1::Monomial, m2::Monomial)` to start returning a `Polynomial` (breaking but safest), or keep `*` as raw concatenation and introduce a “safe” multiply/constructor (`nf`, `mul_nf`, etc.)?

User:
What I meant to say is: given a vector of integers each representing a non-commuting variable hencing representing a monomial in its entierity, the constructor `Monomial` should find the normal form of the monomial (i.e after physical site based commutation and simplification via unipotency etc) and construct such a Monomial. The only concern I have is: normal form of bosonic operator string is a weighted sum of bosnonic operator string (the normal order ones) is there an elegant, julian way to represent Monomial of Bosonic Operator String? If unclear, keep asking me questions.

Assistant:
Hi.
Invariant-first; bugs nowhere to hide.

- Bosonic case: “normal form” of a word is **not a monomial**; it’s a weighted sum of normal‑ordered words ⇒ represent it as `Polynomial{BosonicAlgebra}` (your current `Polynomial` is already the right container: coeff + `Monomial{BosonicAlgebra}` terms).
- Make `Monomial{BosonicAlgebra}` mean **basis word only** (already normal‑ordered). Enforce in constructor: if the input word is not normal‑ordered, throw and tell the user to call `simplify`/`normal_form`.
- Add a single entrypoint like `normal_form(::Type{A}, word)::Polynomial{A}` that does “commute-by-site + algebra simplify”; for algebras where `simplify(::Monomial)` returns `Monomial`/`Term`, just lift to a 1‑term `Polynomial`.

Clarify: do you want `Monomial{PauliAlgebra}(word)` to also absorb the ±i phase (so it can’t return a `Monomial` either), or is “normal form” for you only the commuting/site ordering part?

User:
How about this "struct Monomial{A,T} <: AbstractMonomial
    normal_word::Vector{T}
end

struct PauliMonomial{T} <: AbstractMonomial
    phase::ComplexF64
    normal_word::Vector{T}
end

# Suggest a better name, more mathematical
struct PhysicsMonomial{A,T} <: Abstractmonomial
    weight::Vector{Float64}
    normal_words::Vector{Vector{T}}
end
" where A is algebras and T are index types for variable

Assistant:
Hi.
Name things by algebra, not by hope.

- Your `PauliMonomial{T}(phase, normal_word)` is exactly `Term{Monomial{PauliAlgebra,T},ComplexF64}` (scalar × basis word). I’d reuse `Term`, not add a new “monomial” type.
- Your `PhysicsMonomial{A,T}(weights, normal_words)` is exactly a `Polynomial{A,T,C}` (linear combination of basis words). More mathematical name: `NormalForm` or `LinearCombination`; but really it *is* a polynomial.
- Keep `Monomial{A,T}` = **canonical basis word only** (normal-ordered word, no coefficients, no sums). Enforce in constructor/check.
- Provide one “from raw word” API that always works: `normal_form(::Type{A}, word)::Polynomial{A}` (even for Pauli; returns 1-term poly if no expansion).

Clarify: do you want to *forbid* constructing non-normal-ordered `Monomial{BosonicAlgebra}` (throw), and force users through `normal_form/simplify` for boson/fermion?

User:
but lacking PauliMonomial and PhysicsMonomial lacks the ability to clearly mark when is an object a member in the basis and when is it really a polynomial

Assistant:
Hi.
Clear types; clear algebra.

- You already have the “basis vs polynomial” markers:
  - basis element (single word, coef = 1): `Monomial{A,T}`
  - “PauliMonomial” (phase × one word): `Term{Monomial{PauliAlgebra,T},ComplexF64}`
  - “PhysicsMonomial” (Σ weightᵢ * wordᵢ): `Polynomial{A,T,C}` (this is the mathematical object; don’t name it “monomial”)

- Most Julian way to get your naming without duplicating structs: type aliases + API names:
  ```julia
  const BasisWord{A,T} = Monomial{A,T}
  const ScaledWord{A,T,C} = Term{Monomial{A,T},C}
  const NormalForm{A,T,C} = Polynomial{A,T,C}
  ```
  Then expose `normal_form(::Monomial)::NormalForm` (always a polynomial; 1-term for most algebras).

- If you also want “raw word” vs “already-normal” tracked by type (not just by convention), you need a *wrapper* (`RawWord`/`NormalWord`) or a separate `RawMonomial` type; adding `PauliMonomial/PhysicsMonomial` just reimplements `Term/Polynomial`.

Question: do you need the distinction for dispatch/safety (compiler-enforced), or just for readability in the public API/docs?

User:
I need it for for dispatch/safety (compiler-enforced). If I can guarantee each monomial is always in normal form, then comparision defined on monomials will be less error prone

Assistant:
Hi.
Strong invariants; weak bugs.

- You already have the 3 compiler-enforced “buckets” you want:
  - **basis element**: `Monomial{A,T}` (one normal-ordered word)
  - **scaled basis element** (Pauli phase etc): `Term{Monomial{A,T},C}`
  - **sum** (boson/fermion normal form): `Polynomial{A,T,C}`
  - So `PauliMonomial` ≅ `Term{Monomial{PauliAlgebra,T},ComplexF64}`, and “PhysicsMonomial” ≅ `Polynomial`.

- The missing piece is **preventing non-normal words from ever becoming `Monomial`**. For that you need a separate “raw” carrier type, e.g. `RawWord{A,T}` (or a `NormalizationTag` type parameter).
  - `Monomial{A,T}`: only constructible if `word` already satisfies the basis invariants (site-sorted / normal-ordered / idempotency applied / etc). Otherwise throw.
  - `normal_form(::Type{A}, word)::Polynomial{A}`: the *smart constructor* that rewrites a raw word into the canonical algebra element:
    - returns `Monomial` for algebras with 1-word normal form (projector/unipotent/…)
    - returns `Term` for Pauli
    - returns `Polynomial` for boson/fermion

- Then comparisons stay safe by construction: `==/hash/isless` defined on `Monomial` assumes “already normal”; raw words don’t get those methods (or they error).

Two clarifiers:
1) Do you want `*(::Monomial, ::Monomial)` to **return canonical** (i.e. `Term/Polynomial` depending on algebra), or keep `*` fast and force an explicit `normal_form` step?
2) For fermions: should “nilpotent words” be **unconstructible as `Monomial`** (since they’re zero), or allowed but treated specially?

User:
Hold on, what about this design: "struct Monomial{A,T} <: AbstractMonomial
    # always guaranteed to be normal
    # 1. For non-commutative meaning site sorted
    # 2. For unipotent, projective algebra, in addition to site sorted, meaning simplified to no-consecutive
    # 3. For Pauli algebra, in addition to site sorted, meaning at most 1 pauli operator for each site
    # 4. For fermionic and bosonic algebra: meaning all creation operators on the left of anhilation operators and creation/anhilation operators are sorted according to physical site
    normal_word::Vector{T}
end

struct ComposedMonomial{AS} <:AbstractMonomial
    normal_monos::Tuple{AS} # not sure if this is correct
end

# Type needs to be more careful, perhaps only 2 MT <: AbstractMonomial , could be either Monomial{A,T} or ComposedMonomial{AS}
struct Polynomial{A,T,F} <: AbstractPolynomial
    # We lose the notion of Term here
    coeffs::Vector{F}
    monos::Vector{Monomial{A,T}} # Vector{ComposedMonomial{AS}} in general
end

struct PauliMonomial{T}
    phase::ComplexF64
    normal_word::Vector{Monomial{PauliAlgebra,T}}
end

# Suggest a better name, more mathematical
struct PhysicsMonomial{A,T} # here A can only be either FermionicAlgebra or BosonicAlgebra
    weight::Vector{Float64}
    normal_words::Vector{Monomial{A,T}}
end
"

Assistant:
Hi.
Type-invariants; fearless refactors.

- Rejecting non-basis words for `Pauli/Fermion/Boson` is consistent: their “normal form” lives in coefficients/sums, not in `Monomial`.
- Consequence: `*(::Monomial{Pauli/Boson/Fermion}, ::Monomial{...})` must return a **element** type (your `Polynomial`), not a `Monomial`, otherwise you can’t even build `σx₁*σy₁` or `c₁*c₁†`.
- If you remove `Term`, then `PauliMonomial` is just “a Term for Pauli”; and `PhysicsMonomial` is just `Polynomial` restricted to `{Bosonic,Fermionic}`. You’ll either (a) allocate 1-term `Polynomial`s everywhere, or (b) reinvent `Term` anyway.
- Constructor policy:
  - `Monomial{NonCommutative/Projector/Unipotent}(word)` can canonicalize (site-sort + local rule) and store.
  - `Monomial{Pauli}(word)` should *check* “already reduced basis” (site-sorted + ≤1 op per site) else throw.
  - `Monomial{Boson/Fermion}(word)` should *check* `is_normal_ordered(word)` else throw.

Two questions:
1) OK with algebra-dependent `*` return type (monomial for some, polynomial for others), or do you want `*` to always return `Polynomial` for uniformity?
2) “Make a note”: where should I write it (`CLAUDE.md`, or should I add a repo-root `AGENTS.md`)?

User:
Always normal could be enforced by simplification process in the constructor for algebra that simplies from monomial to monomial. I am willing to reject inputs that are not normal from pauli, fermi, bosonic algebra. I will remove Term and simplify Polynomial accordingly. I will remove Term, I like my chances of keeping them invariant (but do make a note about this). There's no need for raw monomial, its just a thin wrapper around vector of integers. There is no need for normal form, constructor forces normal form.

Assistant:
Hi.
Type-invariants; fearless refactors.

- If `m1*m2` must always return a “monomial-ish” object, then for boson/fermion that object **must be a linear combination** (your `PhysicsMonomial`), because δ/commutator terms are real.
- Then you’re forced into full distributive algebra anyway (`+(…), *(…), adjoint, simplify, combine-like-terms, sort/dedup/zero-drop`) on `PhysicsMonomial`, plus mixed ops (`Monomial * PhysicsMonomial`, etc.). Easiest: make **one canonical sum type** (call it `NormalForm`/`NCElement`/`LinearCombination`) and treat `Monomial` and `PauliMonomial` as 0/1-term special cases (or wrappers) that **promote** to it for `+`/general `*`.
- Warning: removing `Term` means you will reimplement it as `PauliMonomial` (1-term fast path). If you skip the fast path, you’ll allocate 1-term vectors everywhere.

Clarify (core): when you say “entries of moment matrices are monomials”, do you mean the **moment labels** `u†v` (single basis word) or the **symbolic matrix entries** after applying CCR/CAR (often sums)?

User:
1. yes 2. Why would I need to support Monomial * PhysicsMonomial? Elaborate more on sum type 3. What do you mean by fast path? I don't expect to store PauliMonomial in Polynomial. In Polynomial, we will only store Monomial  4. I meant the moment labels u†v

Assistant:
Hi.
Clean invariants; scalable algebra.

- Moment labels `u†v`: for CCR/CAR, `u†v` in the **quotient algebra** can equal a *linear combination* of normal‑ordered words (e.g. `c c† = c† c + 1`). So the *moment variables* should still be keyed by **basis** `Monomial{A,T}`; the matrix entry is then a linear combo of those basis moments.
- `Monomial * PhysicsMonomial`: closure pressure. Localizing entries look like `u† * (Σ cₖ wₖ) * v`. Even if you start with `Monomial*Monomial`, you quickly get a sum, then you still need `sum * Monomial` (or you must special-case “3-arg multiply then simplify” everywhere).
- “Sum type”: one `AbstractElement` with concrete variants `{basis word, scaled word, linear-combo}` + promotion rules for mixed ops. That’s exactly the role of `Term` (scaled word) + `Polynomial` (linear combo) in your current code.
- “Fast path”: avoid allocating length‑1 `coeffs/monos` vectors. Your `PauliMonomial` is that fast path (i.e. it *is* `Term` under a new name).

Clarifier: do you want the JuMP monomap/dictionary keys to stay `Monomial{A,T}` only (recommended), or do you intend to create independent moment variables for `PhysicsMonomial` sums too?

User:
in summary, do you advice for or against such rewrite?

Assistant:
Hi.
Small diff; big invariant win.

- Against full rewrite (drop `Term`, add `PauliMonomial`/`PhysicsMonomial`): you’ll reimplement `Term`/`Polynomial` anyway, plus N×M mixed-method surface (`Monomial×PhysicsMonomial`, `+`, `adjoint`, hashing, sorting, combine-like-terms, zero-drop).
- For incremental change: keep `Monomial{A,T}` = **basis word, always canonical**, and enforce that in constructors for algebras where “normalize” stays 1 word (NC/Projector/Unipotent).
- For Pauli/boson/fermion: `Monomial{A}(word)` should be **checked-only** (reject non-basis words); algebraic multiplication should return an **element** type (your current `Term` for Pauli, `Polynomial` for boson/fermion).
- Moment labels `u†v`: keep as `Monomial{A,T}` keys; matrix entries become linear combos of those labels (already what your `simplify` pipeline models).
- If you really want “monomial-ish closure”, reuse existing types but rename via aliases (basis/scaled/sum). Don’t delete `Term`; it’s the needed 1-term fast path.

Where should I write the “note” you asked for earlier (`CLAUDE.md` vs a new `AGENTS.md` at repo root)?

User:
to a new `AGENTS.md` at repo root

Assistant:
Hi.
Notes now; refactors later.

- Added repo-root note in `AGENTS.md:1` re: dropping `Term` (expect reintroducing 1-term fast path + mixed-op closure pressure).
- FYI: untracked `imagined.jl:1` appeared (your sketch); tell me if you want it kept/ignored/trashed.
