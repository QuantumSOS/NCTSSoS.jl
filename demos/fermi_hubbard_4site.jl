# Demo: 4-site Fermi-Hubbard model — ground state energy and correlations
#
# Persona: condensed matter physicist, no optimization background.
# Tests: full pipeline (problem ID → algebra → formulation → solve),
#        FermionicAlgebra, correlation extraction from moments.
#
# Problem:
#   H = -t Σᵢ(c†ᵢσ cᵢ₊₁σ + h.c.) + U Σᵢ nᵢ↑ nᵢ↓
#   4 sites, periodic boundary conditions, t=1, U=4.
#
# Important: as written, this is the grand-canonical Hamiltonian. There is no
# particle-number constraint here, so this script does *not* enforce half-filling.
# For these parameters the exact full-Fock ground-state energy is about -3.41855.
# If you want the half-filled problem, add particle-number constraints explicitly.

# --- Parameters ---
N = 4        # number of sites
t = 1.0      # hopping
U = 4.0      # on-site interaction

# --- Variables ---
# Spin-up and spin-down fermions on each site share one registry but use
# disjoint fermionic modes, so nᵢ↑ nᵢ↓ stays quartic instead of collapsing to nᵢ.

# Hopping: -t Σᵢσ (c†ᵢσ cᵢ₊₁σ + h.c.), periodic boundary

)
ham_hop_dn = -t * sum(
    c_dn_dag[i] * c_dn[mod1(i+1, N)] + c_dn_dag[mod1(i+1, N)] * c_dn[i]

# Total Hamiltonian
ham = ham_hop_up + ham_hop_dn + ham_int

# --- Solve ---
# 4 sites × 2 spins = 8 fermionic modes → 16 variables (c + c†)
# order=2 is the standard starting point

# --- Correlation: ⟨Sᶻ₁ Sᶻ₂⟩ ---
# Sᶻᵢ = (nᵢ↑ - nᵢ↓)/2 = (c†ᵢ↑cᵢ↑ - c†ᵢ↓cᵢ↓)/2
# ⟨Sᶻ₁ Sᶻ₂⟩ can be read from the solved moment map.
# After solving, the moment map contains ⟨m⟩ for each monomial m in the basis.
#
# To extract:
#   Sz1_Sz2 = (1/4) * (⟨n₁↑n₂↑⟩ - ⟨n₁↑n₂↓⟩ - ⟨n₁↓n₂↑⟩ + ⟨n₁↓n₂↓⟩)
#
# This requires accessing result's moment data — see the postprocessing guide
# in the polyopt-guide skill for the low-level moment map API.
