    SympleQGraph

Coloured graph used for SympleQ automorphism discovery.

The first `length(pauli_vertices)` vertices are Pauli-term vertices. Auxiliary
cycle vertices, when present, are stored after them and coloured separately so a
colour-preserving automorphism cannot confuse terms with cycle constraints.

Build the colour-preserving graph for SympleQ Steps 1--3: Pauli-term vertices
are coloured by coefficient magnitude, with an edge for each anticommuting
pair. The canonical word phase `η` and coefficient sign/phase are handled by
the later Clifford phase lift; making them graph colours would incorrectly
reject valid Clifford symmetries such as global `S` rotations that exchange `X`
and `Y` terms.
