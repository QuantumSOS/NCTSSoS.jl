# [Polynomial Optimization] (@id PolynomialOptimization)

Polynomial optimization is a mathematical optimization problem where the
objective function is polynomial and the constraints are polynomial inequalities
[wangExploitingTermSparsity2021](@cite). In general, finding the exact solution
to a polynomial optimization problem is NP-hard. However, [moment](@ref
MomentRelaxation) and [sum-of-squares](@ref SOSRelaxation) can be applied to
solve polynomial optimization problems efficiently.
