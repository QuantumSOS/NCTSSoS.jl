# Certifying Ground State

Finding the ground state of a quantum system is a fundamental problem in quantum
mechanics [wang2024Certifying](@cite). Variational methods are commonly used to
approximate the ground state. Due to the variational nature of these methods,
only an upper bound can be obtained [kull2024Lower](@cite). Polynomial
optimization techniques provides a way to find the lower bound of the ground
state energy. With such lower bound, estimates of properties of the ground
state, correlations functions, structure factors and order parameters, can also
be obtained. We provide examples on 1D and 2D Heisenberg models.

In general, we consider the following Hamiltonian:
```math
H = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i < j} J_{ij} \sum_{ a \in \{x,y,z\}} \sigma_i^a \sigma_j^a
```

## 1D Heisenberg Model with Nearest Neighbor Interaction

Firstly, let's consider the simplest case of 1D Heisenberg chain with nearest
neighbor interaction and periodic boundary condition.



## 1D Heisenberg Model with next nearest neighbor interaction

Adding next nearest neighbor interaction induced geometric frustration.
